## Questions

### Q1: Counterparty Credit Risk
Consider a portfolio of OTC (over-the-counter) contracts with a single counterparty.

- What is the expected loss on this portfolio if the counterparty defaults?
- How would you measure the potential loss in extreme scenarios (e.g., 99.9th percentile)?

### Q2: Risk Measures
Explain the difference between:
- Expected Shortfall (ES)
- Value at Risk (VaR)

Which one is more appropriate for capturing tail risk in credit portfolios?

### Q3: Hedging
Why is hedging more challenging in OTC markets compared to exchange-traded derivatives?
