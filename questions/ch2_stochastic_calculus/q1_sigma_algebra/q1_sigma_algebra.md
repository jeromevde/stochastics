# Q1: σ-algebra generated by a set

## Question
Let Ω = {1,2,3,4,5,6} (rolling a fair dice). 

Give the smallest σ-algebra 𝒢 generated by the set {1,3,5} (the odd numbers).

## Answer
𝒢 = {∅, {1,3,5}, {2,4,6}, Ω}

## Explanation
The smallest σ-algebra generated by A = {1,3,5} must contain:
1. A itself = {1,3,5}
2. Its complement Aᶜ = {2,4,6}
3. The empty set ∅ (required)
4. The whole space Ω = {1,2,3,4,5,6} (required)

Since taking unions of these sets doesn't produce new elements, this is the complete σ-algebra.

## Events you can describe
- **"odd"** → {1,3,5}
- **"even"** → {2,4,6}
- **"nothing"** → ∅
- **"everything"** → Ω

You **cannot** describe events like {1}, {3,4}, etc. — those aren't measurable in 𝒢.

## Definitions

### σ-algebra (σ-field)
A collection 𝒢 of subsets of Ω is a σ-algebra if:
1. **Ω ∈ 𝒢** (contains the whole space)
2. **Closed under complements**: If A ∈ 𝒢, then Aᶜ ∈ 𝒢
3. **Closed under countable unions**: If A₁, A₂, ... ∈ 𝒢, then ⋃ₙ Aₙ ∈ 𝒢

**Intuition**: The sets in a σ-algebra are the "measurable" events we can assign probabilities to.

### Generated σ-algebra σ(A)
The smallest σ-algebra containing a collection of sets A. It's formed by taking all possible countable unions and complements of sets in A.

### Borel σ-algebra ℬ(ℝ)
The σ-algebra generated by all open intervals in ℝ. Contains all "nice" subsets of ℝ (open, closed, countable unions, etc.).

### Measurable space (Ω, 𝒢)
A pair consisting of a sample space Ω and a σ-algebra 𝒢 on it. This is the domain where probability measures are defined.

### Probability measure P
A function P: 𝒢 → [0,1] such that:
1. P(Ω) = 1
2. Countable additivity: If A₁, A₂, ... are disjoint, P(⋃ₙ Aₙ) = Σₙ P(Aₙ)

### Probability triple (Ω, 𝒢, P)
Complete specification of a probability space.
