**Question 5:** You're short an American put on a stock struck at $100. Is the optimal exercise time a stopping time? (Yes/No)

**Answer**: Yes

**Remember**: A stopping time τ can't peek into the future. Since exercise decisions only use information available at time t, American option exercise times are valid stopping times.
