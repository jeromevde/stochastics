**Question 4:** A stock price can be either $100 (with probability 0.6) or $80 (with probability 0.4). What is the conditional expectation of the price given that it is below $90?

**Answer**: $80

**Remember**: Conditional expectation E[X|A] = expected value on a restricted probability space. Here we're taking the expectation only over outcomes where price < $90.
