**Question 7:** Brownian motion is continuous with independent, normal increments. If B_0 = 0 and B_1 ~ N(0,1), what is the variance of B_2?

**Answer**: 2

**Remember**: Brownian motion has Var(B_t) = t. The variance grows linearly with time, matching real asset price geometric random walk behavior.
