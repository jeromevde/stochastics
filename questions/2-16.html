      <strong>Definitions:</strong>
      A function has bounded variation on an interval if the total absolute change along any partition is bounded. A function is differentiable at a point if its derivative exists there. Brownian motion is continuous but highly irregular.
      <strong>Reasoning:</strong>
      Despite being continuous everywhere, Brownian motion paths are almost surely nowhere differentiable—they have "corners" everywhere. This extreme roughness also implies unbounded variation on any non-trivial interval. The quadratic variation being $t$ (not zero) is another manifestation of this roughness. These properties make standard calculus inapplicable, necessitating stochastic calculus.
      <strong>Answer:</strong>
      Brownian motion has almost surely nowhere differentiable paths.
      <strong>Practical Use Case:</strong>
      The nowhere-differentiable property of Brownian motion explains why instantaneous returns $dS_t/dt$ are undefined in continuous-time models. Instead, we work with stochastic differentials $dS_t = \mu S_t dt + \sigma S_t dB_t$, where the second term dominates at small time scales. This mathematical property has practical implications: high-frequency trading algorithms must account for the fact that price changes over microseconds behave more like random walks than smooth trends. The unbounded variation also explains why delta-hedging requires continuous rebalancing in theory—though in practice, discrete rebalancing at regular intervals approximates the continuous hedge.
