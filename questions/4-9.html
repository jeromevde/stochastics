    <div class="q-explanation">
      <strong>Definitions:</strong> The Vasicek model has several desirable properties: tractability (analytical bond pricing formulas), mean reversion (realistic feature), and Gaussian dynamics (easy simulation). However, the Gaussian assumption has an important consequence.<br><br>
      <strong>Reasoning:</strong> Since $r(t)$ follows a normal distribution, it can take any value on the real line, including negative values. This was historically viewed as unrealistic since interest rates were thought to have a zero lower bound. However, in recent years, some central banks have implemented negative interest rates, making this "drawback" less severe in practice. Still, for modeling purposes, alternatives like CIR that guarantee positive rates are sometimes preferred.<br><br>
      <strong>Answer:</strong> The key drawback is that short rates can become negative.
