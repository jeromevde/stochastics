# 4.2 Vasicek Short Rate Model

Interest rates in financial markets come in different forms depending on their time horizon. The **long rate** $R(t,T)$ represents the continuously compounded zero coupon rate that you can lock in at time $t$ for an investment maturing at time $T$. This is the yield on a bond that pays nothing until maturity.

However, the fundamental building block for interest rate modeling is the **short rate** $r(t)$, which represents the instantaneous risk-free rate at time $t$. The relationship between these rates is:

$$r(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} R(t, t + \Delta t)$$

In other words, the short rate is the theoretical interest rate for borrowing money for an infinitesimally short period of time.

The long rate $R(t,T)$ can be understood as the market's expectation of the average short rate over the period $[t,T]$, plus a risk premium:

$$R(t,T) \approx \frac{1}{T-t} \mathbb{E}\left[ \int_t^T r(s) \, ds \right] + \text{Risk Premium}$$

## The Vasicek Model

Vasicek's model directly models the dynamics of the short rate $r(t)$ using the following stochastic differential equation:

$$\boxed{ dr(t) = \kappa(\theta - r(t)) \, dt + \sigma \, dB(t) }$$

where $B(t)$ denotes standard Brownian motion.

This model captures two essential features of interest rates:

- **Mean Reversion**: The drift term $\kappa(\theta - r(t))$ pulls the rate toward a long-term mean level $\theta$ at speed $\kappa$.
- **Stochastic Volatility**: The diffusion term $\sigma \, dB(t)$ adds random fluctuations with volatility $\sigma$.

The mean reversion property is crucial because interest rates in reality do not follow a random walk. They tend to revert to some equilibrium level due to economic forces and central bank policies.

The model has the following computational advantages:
- Analytic formulas for bond prices and bond option prices
- Exact simulation of both the short rate and its integral is possible

## Solving the Vasicek SDE

The Vasicek model is an example of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We can find an explicit formula for $r(t)$ by solving the SDE.

> **Proof: Solution of the Vasicek SDE**
> 
> 1. **Rearrange the SDE:**
>    $$dr(t) = \kappa(\theta - r(t))dt + \sigma dB(t)$$
>    $$dr(t) + \kappa r(t) dt = \kappa \theta dt + \sigma dB(t)$$
> 
> 2. **Introduce an Integrating Factor:** We use the integrating factor $e^{\kappa t}$. Let's consider the process $X_t = e^{\kappa t} r(t)$. We can find its differential using Itô's Lemma:
>    $$d(e^{\kappa t} r(t)) = \kappa e^{\kappa t} r(t) dt + e^{\kappa t} dr(t)$$
> 
> 3. **Substitute the SDE:** Now, substitute the expression for $dr(t)$ from step 1:
>    $$d(e^{\kappa t} r(t)) = \kappa e^{\kappa t} r(t) dt + e^{\kappa t} (\kappa \theta dt - \kappa r(t) dt + \sigma dB(t))$$
> 
> 4. **Simplify:** The terms involving $r(t)dt$ cancel out:
>    $$d(e^{\kappa t} r(t)) = \kappa \theta e^{\kappa t} dt + \sigma e^{\kappa t} dB(t)$$
> 
> 5. **Integrate:** We can now integrate both sides from time 0 to $t$:
>    $$\int_0^t d(e^{\kappa s} r(s)) = \int_0^t \kappa \theta e^{\kappa s} ds + \int_0^t \sigma e^{\kappa s} dB(s)$$
>    $$e^{\kappa t} r(t) - r(0) = \theta (e^{\kappa t} - 1) + \sigma \int_0^t e^{\kappa s} dB(s)$$
> 
> 6. **Solve for r(t):** Finally, multiply by $e^{-\kappa t}$ to isolate $r(t)$:
>    $$\boxed{r(t) = r(0)e^{-\kappa t} + \theta(1 - e^{-\kappa t}) + \sigma \int_0^t e^{-\kappa(t-s)} dB(s)}$$

This is the explicit solution for the Vasicek short rate model. It shows that $r(t)$ is normally distributed, which is a key feature that allows for analytic formulas for bond prices.

## Remember

- **Short rate** $r(t)$: instantaneous risk-free rate
- **Long rate** $R(t,T)$: average expected short rate + risk premium
- **Vasicek SDE**: $dr(t) = \kappa(\theta - r(t))dt + \sigma dB(t)$
- **Mean reversion**: $\kappa$ controls speed, $\theta$ is the long-term mean
- **Solution**: $r(t) = r(0)e^{-\kappa t} + \theta(1 - e^{-\kappa t}) + \sigma \int_0^t e^{-\kappa(t-s)} dB(s)$
- $r(t)$ is normally distributed → analytic bond pricing formulas
