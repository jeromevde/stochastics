    <div class="q-text">Why do we need a stochastic *process* rather than just a random variable to price certain derivatives?</div>
    <div class="q-options">
      <button class="q-option" data-idx="0"><span class="q-letter">A</span><span>Because all derivatives have multiple payment dates</span></button>
      <button class="q-option" data-idx="1"><span class="q-letter">B</span><span>Because some derivatives (e.g. lookback options) depend on the asset value at multiple future times</span></button>

      <strong>Definitions:</strong>
      A random variable represents a single uncertain outcome at one point in time. A stochastic process is a collection of random variables indexed by time, describing how a quantity evolves over time. Path-dependent derivatives are contracts whose payoff depends on the history of the underlying asset's price, not just its final value.
      <strong>Reasoning:</strong>
      For European options, we only need the asset price at maturity, so a single random variable suffices. However, lookback options pay based on the maximum or minimum price over the contract's life:
      $$\text{Lookback Call Payoff} = \max_{0 \le t \le T} S_t - S_T$$
      This requires knowing the entire path $(S_t)_{t \in [0,T]}$, not just $S_T$. Only a stochastic process can model this evolution.
      <strong>Answer:</strong>
      Path-dependent derivatives require a stochastic process because their payoffs depend on multiple asset values over time.
      <strong>Practical Use Case:</strong>
      Lookback options are used in executive compensation and commodity hedging. For example, an oil producer might purchase a lookback put that pays based on the difference between the highest oil price during the year and the final price, providing protection while allowing participation in price rallies. Asian options (whose payoff depends on the average price over time) are widely used in currency hedging by multinationals to smooth out exchange rate volatility when they have regular foreign currency cash flows throughout a quarter or year.
