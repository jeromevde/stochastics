# Q3: Measurable Function

## Question
Let (Ω, 𝒜) = (ℝ, 𝔅(ℝ)) be the measurable space with the Borel σ-algebra. Is the function f: ℝ → ℝ defined by f(x) = x² measurable with respect to 𝔅(ℝ)?

---

## Answer

**Yes, f(x) = x² is Borel measurable.**

### Why This Matters (Intuition)

In finance, we work with **random variables** — functions that assign a real number to each outcome of a random experiment. For example, the price of a stock tomorrow is a function S(ω) of the underlying uncertainty ω.

But we can only *compute expectations* (average values) of these random variables if they're **measurable**. Intuitively:
- Measurability = "we can assign probabilities to the outcomes"
- Without measurability, we can't integrate — the math breaks down

Think of it like this: a function is measurable if the σ-algebra on the domain is rich enough to "see" all the sets we need to describe where the function takes certain values.

### Key Definition

A function f: (Ω, 𝒜) → ℝ is **measurable** if for every Borel set B ∈ 𝔅(ℝ), the preimage f⁻¹(B) ∈ 𝒜.

In plain English: "The inverse image of any measurable set is measurable."

### What Does f: (Ω, 𝒜) → ℝ Mean?

Let's break down each component:

| Symbol | Meaning | Finance Example |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| **Ω** (omega) | The set of all possible "outcomes" or "states of the world" | All possible market scenarios tomorrow (up, down, crash, etc.) |
| **𝒜** (sigma) | The σ-algebra — the collection of "measurable events" we can assign probabilities to | All events we can talk about: {price > $100}, {market goes up}, etc. |
| **ℝ** (the arrow →) | The codomain — the space where the function's values live | Real numbers (stock prices, returns, etc.) |

So **f: (Ω, 𝒜) → ℝ** means: "A function that takes a state of the world ω ∈ Ω and outputs a real number f(ω)."

Think of it as a machine:
```
ω (random outcome) → f → f(ω) (real number, e.g., stock price)
```

### The Preimage Intuition

Here's the key insight:

> **To check if f is measurable, we check if we can trace back from any OUTPUT condition to an INPUT condition we already know is measurable.**

In practice, this means: for any question about the output like "Is f(ω) > 5?", we can rephrase it as a question about the input: "Is ω in the preimage f⁻¹((5, ∞))?"

| Output Question | Input Question (Preimage) |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| "Is f(ω) > 5?" | "Is ω ∈ f⁻¹((5, ∞))?" |
| "Is f(ω) ≤ a?" | "Is ω ∈ f⁻¹((-∞, a])?" |

If we can always answer the input question (because the preimage is in 𝒜), then we can answer the output question. This is **essential for integration** — we need to know that the set {ω : f(ω) > c} is measurable before we can compute probabilities or expectations.

**In finance:** Stock prices S(t, ω) are functions of uncertainty. For S(t) to model risk, events like {ω : S(t, ω) > strike} must be measurable — otherwise we can't compute option payoffs or risk measures.

### Proof

Since f is continuous and 𝔅(ℝ) is generated by intervals of the form (-∞, a], it's enough to check these (this is a standard trick — check the generators).

For any a ∈ ℝ:
- **If a < 0**: No real number squares to a negative number → f⁻¹((-∞, a]) = ∅ ∈ 𝔅(ℝ)
- **If a ≥ 0**: We need x² ≤ a → x ∈ [-√a, √a], which is a closed interval, hence Borel

Since preimages of the generating sets are measurable, f is measurable.

**Conclusion:** f is Borel measurable.

## Remark

In fact, **every continuous function** f: ℝ → ℝ is Borel measurable. This is great for finance: stock prices modeled by continuous paths (like Black-Scholes) are automatically measurable, so we can take expectations without worry.

## Remember

- **Measurable function**: f: (Ω, 𝒜) → ℝ is measurable if f⁻¹(B) ∈ 𝒜 for every Borel set B ∈ 𝔅(ℝ)
- **Borel σ-algebra 𝔅(ℝ)**: The σ-algebra generated by all open intervals in ℝ; contains all "nice" sets we're typically working with
- **Key insight**: To check measurability, it's enough to check preimages of generating sets (like (-∞, a])
