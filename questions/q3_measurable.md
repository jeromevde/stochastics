# Q3: Measurable Function

## Question
Let (Ω, 𝒜) = (ℝ, 𝔅(ℝ)) be the measurable space with the Borel σ-algebra. Is the function f: ℝ → ℝ defined by f(x) = x² measurable with respect to 𝔅(ℝ)?

## Answer

**Yes, f(x) = x² is Borel measurable.**

### Why This Matters (Intuition)

In finance, we work with **random variables** — functions that assign a real number to each outcome of a random experiment. For example, the price of a stock tomorrow is a function S(ω) of the underlying uncertainty ω.

But we can only *compute expectations* (average values) of these random variables if they're **measurable**. Intuitively:
- Measurability = "we can assign probabilities to the outcomes"
- Without measurability, we can't integrate — the math breaks down

Think of it like this: a function is measurable if the σ-algebra on the domain is rich enough to "see" all the sets we need to describe where the function takes certain values.

### Key Definition

A function f: (Ω, 𝒜) → ℝ is **measurable** if for every Borel set B ∈ 𝔅(ℝ), the preimage f⁻¹(B) ∈ 𝒜.

In plain English: "The inverse image of any measurable set is measurable."

### Proof

Since f is continuous and 𝔅(ℝ) is generated by intervals of the form (-∞, a], it's enough to check these (this is a standard trick — check the generators).

For any a ∈ ℝ:
- **If a < 0**: No real number squares to a negative number → f⁻¹((-∞, a]) = ∅ ∈ 𝔅(ℝ)
- **If a ≥ 0**: We need x² ≤ a → x ∈ [-√a, √a], which is a closed interval, hence Borel

Since preimages of the generating sets are measurable, f is measurable.

**Conclusion:** f is Borel measurable.

## Remark

In fact, **every continuous function** f: ℝ → ℝ is Borel measurable. This is great for finance: stock prices modeled by continuous paths (like Black-Scholes) are automatically measurable, so we can take expectations without worry.
