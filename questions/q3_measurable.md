# Q3: Measurable Function

## Question
Let (Ω, 𝒜) = (ℝ, 𝔅(ℝ)) be the measurable space with the Borel σ-algebra. Is the function f: ℝ → ℝ defined by f(x) = x² measurable with respect to 𝔅(ℝ)?

---

## Answer

**Yes, f(x) = x² is Borel measurable.**

### Key Definition

A function f: (Ω, 𝒜) → ℝ is **measurable** if for every Borel set B ∈ 𝔅(ℝ), the preimage f⁻¹(B) ∈ 𝒜.

### Proof

Since f is continuous and 𝔅(ℝ) is generated by open intervals, it's enough to check preimages of intervals of the form (-∞, a] for a ∈ ℝ (this generates the Borel σ-algebra).

For any a ∈ ℝ:
- If a < 0: f⁻¹((-∞, a]) = ∅ ∈ 𝔅(ℝ)
- If a ≥ 0: f⁻¹((-∞, a]) = {x ∈ ℝ : x² ≤ a} = [-√a, √a] ∈ 𝔅(ℝ)

The preimage of any Borel set can be expressed as a countable union/intersection of these, so f⁻¹(B) ∈ 𝔅(ℝ) for all B ∈ 𝔅(ℝ).

**Conclusion:** f is Borel measurable.

## Remark
In fact, **every continuous function** f: ℝ → ℝ is Borel measurable.
