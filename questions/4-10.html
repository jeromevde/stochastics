      <strong>Definitions:</strong>
      An affine term structure model is one where bond prices have the exponential-affine form:
      $$P(t,T) = A(t,T) e^{-B(t,T) r(t)}$$
      equivalently, taking logarithms:
      $$\ln P(t,T) = \ln A(t,T) - B(t,T) r(t)$$
      "Affine" means "linear plus constant"—a function of the form $f(x) = a + bx$.
      <strong>Reasoning:</strong>
      The log bond price is
      $$\ln P(t,T) = \ln A(t,T) - B(t,T) \cdot r(t) = \text{constant} + \text{coefficient} \times r(t)$$
      which is an affine (linear) function of the short rate $r(t)$. This structure is extremely powerful because:
      1. Bond prices are explicit functions of the current short rate $r(t)$
      2. The entire yield curve is determined by $r(t)$ and time-dependent functions $A(t,T)$ and $B(t,T)$
      3. The functions $A$ and $B$ satisfy Riccati ODEs that can be solved analytically in Vasicek
      4. Option pricing uses expectations involving exponentials of affine functions, which remain tractable

      The affine class includes Vasicek, CIR, Hull-White, and many multi-factor extensions.
      <strong>Answer:</strong>
      It's affine because $\ln P$ is an affine (linear) function of $r$.
      <strong>Practical Use Case:</strong>
      Affine models dominate interest rate derivatives pricing due to computational efficiency. For vanilla bond options and interest rate caps/floors, traders use closed-form pricing formulas that arise from the affine structure—no Monte Carlo needed. The affine property also enables fast calibration: given market bond prices $P^{\text{market}}(t,T_i)$, quants extract the current short rate $r(t)$ by inverting the affine formula. For large portfolios with thousands of positions, affine models allow real-time risk calculations (computing Greeks) that would be infeasible with non-affine models requiring numerical PDE or Monte Carlo. Investment banks' fixed income trading systems rely heavily on affine models: Vasicek and Hull-White for EUR/USD swaps, CIR for credit spreads, multi-factor affine models for mortgages. The ability to write $\ln P = a - br$ means all interest rate sensitivities (duration, convexity) follow from simple derivatives of affine functions.
