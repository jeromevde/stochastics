      <strong>Definitions:</strong>
      The volatility smile (or skew) refers to the pattern of implied volatilities across different strike prices for options with the same maturity. If Black-Scholes held perfectly, implied volatility would be constant across strikes.
      <strong>Reasoning:</strong>
      In equity markets, we typically observe a volatility skew: implied volatility is higher for out-of-the-money (OTM) puts (low strikes) and lower for OTM calls (high strikes). This reflects market fears of crashes (fat left tail) and asymmetric return distributions. The pattern creates a downward-sloping curve rather than a symmetric smile. This post-1987 phenomenon is sometimes called the "smirk" or "skew."
      <strong>Answer:</strong>
      Higher implied vol for low strikes, lower for high strikes (skew).
    
      <strong>Practical Use Case:</strong>
      This concept is essential for modern financial engineering and quantitative trading. Practitioners apply these principles in derivatives pricing, risk management, and portfolio optimization across asset classes including equities, fixed income, commodities, and FX markets. Understanding this material enables quants to build robust pricing models, traders to identify arbitrage opportunities, and risk managers to compute accurate hedging strategies for complex derivative portfolios.
