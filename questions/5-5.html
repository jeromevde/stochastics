      <strong>Definitions:</strong>
      In the LMM, each forward rate $F_k$ is a martingale under its own forward measure $\mathbb{Q}^{T_{k+1}}$. However, for simulation and pricing complex derivatives, we often need all forward rates expressed under a single common measure.
      <strong>Reasoning:</strong>
      When we change from each rate's natural measure to a common measure (say $\mathbb{Q}^{T_i}$), Girsanov's theorem tells us that drift corrections appear. For forward rate $F_k$ under measure $\mathbb{Q}^{T_i}$, the drift is proportional to $\sum_j \rho_{k,j} \sigma_j \frac{\tau_j F_j}{1 + \tau_j F_j}$, involving correlations, other forward rates, and their volatilities. These drift terms make the system complex and require numerical discretization for Monte Carlo simulation.
      <strong>Answer:</strong>
      Drift corrections involving correlation and other forward rates appear.
    
      <strong>Practical Use Case:</strong>
      When pricing complex derivatives like callable swaps or ratchet caps via Monte Carlo simulation, all forward rates must evolve under a single measure. Implementing these drift corrections correctly is critical - errors lead to arbitrage in the simulated term structure. Quants must discretize the coupled system of SDEs $dF_k = \mu_k dt + \sigma_k F_k dW_k$, where the drift $\mu_k$ depends on correlations $\rho_{k,j}$ and the current values of other rates $F_j$. This interdependence makes numerical schemes like predictor-corrector or log-Euler essential for stable simulations.
