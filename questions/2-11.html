      <strong>Definitions:</strong>
      A filtration $(\mathcal{F}_t)_{t \geq 0}$ represents the information available up to time $t$. A stochastic process $(X_t)$ is adapted to $(\mathcal{F}_t)$ if $X_t$ is $\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable for each $t$, meaning the value of $X_t$ can be determined from the information in $\mathcal{F}_t$.
      <strong>Reasoning:</strong>
      Adaptedness is the mathematical formalization of "no peeking into the future." At time $t$, we can observe $X_t$ using only information available up to that time. This is essential for modeling realistic processes in finance and probability where decisions must be based on current and past information, not future information.
      <strong>Answer:</strong>
      A process is adapted if $X_t$ is $\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable for all $t$.
      <strong>Practical Use Case:</strong>
      Adaptedness is essential for defining admissible trading strategies. A portfolio strategy $\phi_t$ (number of shares held at time $t$) must be adapted to the natural filtration $\mathcal{F}_t = \sigma(S_0, \ldots, S_t)$ generated by past stock prices. This prevents look-ahead bias: you can't decide today's position based on tomorrow's prices. In algorithmic trading, strategies are implemented using only available data—yesterday's close, today's open, current order book—not future prices. Regulators also require that VaR models and stress tests use only information available at the calculation time, ensuring risk measures are based on genuine forecasts, not hindsight.
